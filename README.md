# mac2imgur [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mileswd/mac2imgur.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mileswd/mac2imgur)

A simple and minimalistic Mac application designed to make uploading images to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com) quick and effortless.

## Installation

[Download the latest release](https://mileswd.com/mac2imgur/latest) and move the application to your "Applications" folder.

OS X 10.9 and above is supported, however the latest version of OS X is recommended.

## Usage

The application will listen for new screenshots taken by the [built in screenshot functionality of OS X](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5775), so you can use the following shortcuts to capture your screen:

- Press **[CMD ⌘] - [SHIFT ⇧] - [3]** to take a full-screen screenshot

- Press **[CMD ⌘] - [SHIFT ⇧] - [4]** to take a rectangular selection of the screen

- Press **[CMD ⌘] - [SHIFT ⇧] - [4] - [SPACE]** to capture a specific window, menu or dialog

Disabling this feature and changing other related settings is possible through the preferences menu, however to modify options such as the directory where screenshots are stored, please refer to the relevant [terminal commands](http://secrets.blacktree.com/?showapp=com.apple.screencapture).

In addition, images can be uploaded manually by either:

- Dragging and dropping an image on the status bar icon
- Clicking the "Select Images..." option in the status bar menu

As soon as an image is uploaded, the link is copied to your clipboard and a notification is sent:
